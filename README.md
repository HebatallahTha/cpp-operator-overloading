## 🔧 C++ Operator Overloading

This **C++ program** demonstrates **operator overloading** for a `Job` class. The program showcases the ability to overload various operators, such as `+`, `-`, `==`, `++`, as well as stream insertion and extraction operators. It simulates job time management, calculating and comparing jobs based on their attributes like time and hourly rate.

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ **Addition Operator (`+`)**: Overloaded to add job time to a given integer.  
- ➖ **Subtraction Operator (`-`)**: Overloaded to subtract job time from an integer or compare job times between two `Job` objects.  
- 💻 **Equality Operator (`==`)**: Compares two `Job` objects to check if their job numbers are equal.  
- 🔄 **Increment Operator (`++`)**: Both prefix and postfix increment operators for adjusting the job's hourly rate.  
- 🔠 **Stream Operators (`<<`, `>>`)**: Overloaded to handle input and output of `Job` objects via streams.  
- 🖥️ **User-friendly Interface**: Allows input and output of job details and demonstrates various operator functionalities.
